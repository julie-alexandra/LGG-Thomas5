üìùMoodle

You have to go on moodle every day 4 times (ideally in these slots):
9:00, morning check-in
12:30, morning check-out
13:30, afternoon check-in
17:00, afternoon check-out

Check-in, up to 10 minutes before the time. For example, morning check in can happen from 8:50 to 9:00. 
Check out up to 10 minutes after the time. For example, morning check out can happen from 12:30 to 12:40.

If you forget to check-in or check-out, warn Antoine. DO NOT check-in whenever you are not on campus or in a discord room. This will be considered unjustified absence.

üí¨Discord

Discord is where we have our home working days happen.

When you are in discord, you have to be on a table. You can mute yourself, but you cannot deafen yourself because people have to be able to reach you.

Tech talks happen in the main-room channel. Download: https://discord.com/download

Do not use the @everyone tag because it will notify everyone on the server (approx 500 people). If you want to tag everyone just tag your class (example @Thomas5).

üí°Tech Talks

You can make a tech talk about any tech topic you want, example subjects:
What is AI image generation
How does AI learn
Quiz on Python
What is web development
Data Analysis vs Data Engineering
(Invite a friend who works in the field to explain his job)

These are just silly examples. You can do whichever one you want as long as it is related to tech. The schedule can be found in this spreadsheet which you can edit: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLktNFlFQCHLaEnw_o_0UJDcXnpYxg2ynoZeq_b-iBQ/edit?usp=sharing
