    "# Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, a paper was released by Google called [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). This paper introduced a new architecture, the Transformer (the T in GPT), which presented a pretty radical shift architecturally from the Recurrent Neural Networks. Throughout the years and with experimentation, many AI labs quickly realised we'd be able to scale this archirecture quite easily on text data. After all, the internet contains A LOT of text. So they started making them progressively bigger, and started seeing greater and greater improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2018 – BERT (340M)**\n",
    "  - Introduced bidirectional training using transformers.\n",
    "  - Revolutionized NLP tasks like Q&A and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2019 – GPT-2 (1.5B)**\n",
    "  - First truly general-purpose autoregressive language model.\n",
    "  - Showed coherent long-form text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2020 – GPT-3 (175B)**\n",
    "  - Massive scale jump; strong few-shot and zero-shot performance.\n",
    "  - Sparked public interest in \"AI that can write.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2021 – Megatron-Turing NLG (530B)**\n",
    "  - Largest dense model at the time.\n",
    "  - High performance across language tasks, especially summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2022 – Chinchilla (70B)**\n",
    "  - Smaller than GPT-3 but outperformed it.\n",
    "  - Showed **data efficiency** matters more than size alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2023 – GPT-4 (1.8T)**\n",
    "  - Multimodal (text + vision); stronger reasoning and factual grounding.\n",
    "  - Much better at following nuanced instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2024 – Gemini 1.5 (Undisclosed Size)**\n",
    "  - Long-context capability (over 1M tokens).\n",
    "  - Early glimpse of persistent memory and better tool use.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2025 – GPT-4o (Undisclosed Size)**\n",
    "  - Real-time multimodal interaction (text, audio, vision).\n",
    "  - Natural, fast, human-like responses — huge leap in usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn how these things work, these are amazing videos about them (don't get too lost in them, there is still stuff to do):\n",
    "- [Neural Networks Series – 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M)  \n",
    "  Great intro video to how Transformers operate under the hood.\n",
    "- [Build a GPT from Scratch – Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY)  \n",
    "  A fundamental walkthrough of how LLMs work: attention, MLPs, embeddings, and tokenizers — all built from scratch.\n",
