## Part 1: Exploring CRUD Commands

SQL can be used to perform CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on a database.

- **Download the sample database file**  
- **Connect to the database**:  
  - Open the classic SQL browser for SQLite  
  - Navigate to `File → Open Database`  
  - The sample database file `music.db` can be found in the `data` subdirectory.

### `SELECT … FROM …`

This command allows you to retrieve data from a specific or multiple tables.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

Analyze the syntax.  
- What is the purpose of the `*` symbol?  
- What happens if you don’t include the semicolon?  
- What are the results displayed?

---

### `WHERE`

Add conditions to your results. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE country = "Belgium";
```

---

### `LIMIT`

Limit the number of results:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### `DISTINCT`

Display only unique values:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM customers;
```

How many countries are represented in the data?

---

### `ORDER BY`

Sort the results:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY Country;
```

---

### Try It Yourself

Pick one table and explore it using the commands above. Document your commands and share them with a colleague.

1. Show the first 10 entries of the table `artists`  
2. Find the ID of `Aerosmith`  
3. Find the IDs of the albums of `Aerosmith`

## Creating and Modifying Tables

### `CREATE`

Create a new table called `MyFavoriteTracks`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE MyFavoriteTracks (
  TrackName TEXT,
  Artist TEXT,
  Mood TEXT
);
```

What happens when you run this command?  
Tip: Refresh the schema view to see your new table.

---

### `INSERT`

Add records:

```sql
INSERT INTO MyFavoriteTracks
  (TrackName, Artist, Mood)
VALUES
  ('Silver Springs', 'Fleetwood Mac', 'Dramatic'),
  ('What a feeling', 'Irene Cara', 'Energetic'),
  ('Stairway to Heaven', 'Heart', 'Inspiring');
```

---

### `UPDATE`

Update a record:

```sql
UPDATE TempCustomer
SET Email = "daan_peeters@gmail.com"
WHERE CustomerId = 8;
```

Why is it important to use the `WHERE` clause correctly?

---

### `DELETE`

Delete a record:

```sql
DELETE FROM MyFavoriteTracks WHERE TrackName = 'What a feeling';
```

**⚠ Be careful!** If you omit the `WHERE` clause, all records will be deleted.

---

### Check Your Table

```sql
SELECT * FROM MyFavoriteTracks;
```

---

## Bonus Challenges

- Insert 3 more songs and categorize them by genre.
- Update one song’s mood.
- Delete one track you don’t like anymore.

## Pedagogical Objectives

- Open and navigate the classic SQL browser for SQLite
- Execute basic SQL queries: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Use `WHERE` clauses to filter data
- Understand the logical execution order of SQL commands
- Apply `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`
- (Optional) Use `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, and conditionals for complex filtering
